### Developer Dashboard — The Meta-Layer

Beneath the user-facing settings lies the **Developer Dashboard**: a comprehensive configuration plane where the fundamental architecture of Olen itself is exposed as editable data. **Nothing in Olen is hardcoded.** Every string, calculation, visual rule, and logical branch is a variable stored in `plugin.settings.devConfig` and modifiable through this interface. The Developer Dashboard grants god-mode access to:

**Naming & Lore Architecture**: Every proper noun within the system is a configurable key. Rename the five identity categories (Warrior/Scholar/Artisan/Sage/Herald) to any other taxonomy (e.g., Body/Mind/Craft/Spirit/Social, or Elemental, Chakra-based, or corporate KPIs). Rewrite the composite titles ("Philosopher-King," "Renaissance Soul") or define new title logic based on category combinations. Rebrand "The Oracle" to "The Director," "The Muse," or "Next Action." Change "Eudaimonia Index" to "Mastery Score," "Soul Level," or "Productivity Quotient." Replace "Tartarus" with "The Pit," "Burnout," or "Debt." Every boss name, rank title (Initiate → Explorer → Journeyman), UI label ("Good evening," "Begin Session," "Day Map"), and stoic quote source is an editable string field with localization support.

**Algorithmic Constants**: Expose the Olen Engine's decision logic as tweakable parameters. Adjust the XP-per-completion values, modify the streak bonus multipliers, redefine the neglect threshold calculation (change from fixed days to exponential decay), alter the priority weighting formula, or reconfigure the Day Map generation algorithm (change buffer times between activities, the time-slot boundaries for Morning/Afternoon/Evening, or the waterfall logic order). The "DEATH CHECK → BOSS FINISH → NEGLECT" priority waterfall is a draggable, re-orderable list, not fixed code.

**Visual System Variables**: Override the entire "Elysian Dark" theme at the atomic level. Every color token (`--bg-primary`, `--accent-gold`, `--danger-crimson`) is a color picker input. Font stacks, blur intensities, border radii, animation timings (the 80ms stagger delay), glow opacities, and corner decoration SVG paths are all editable fields. Switch the Hero Card's time-based greeting logic ("Good evening") to use different time boundaries or different greeting templates entirely.

**Structural Modifications**: Redefine the dashboard layout itself. Toggle entire sections on/off (hide the Boss Status, replace the Weekly Rhythm with a custom component). Reorder the vertical scroll (place The Oracle at the top, move Hero to bottom). Modify the Activity Grid column count (2-column vs 3-column). Change the session finish modal's options (add "Partial Flow" between Discipline and Flow, or remove Skipped state entirely). Define new activity property schemas beyond the standard `completed: boolean` — add custom frontmatter fields that Olen will read and display.

**Rule Engine Construction**: Create entirely new rule types beyond `blocks`, `alternatesWith`, and `chainAfter`. Define custom JavaScript-like expressions for activity suggestions (e.g., `if (weather === 'rainy' && category === 'warrior') priority += 5`). Build custom "triggers" (when X happens, do Y) linking any event (streak broken, boss defeated, specific time reached) to any action (create note, send notification, reset category XP, spawn reward).

**Data Schema Mapping**: Remap Olen's data expectations to fit existing vault structures. If the user already has a "Workout" property named `gym` instead of `workout`, or dates formatted as `DD-MM-YYYY` instead of ISO, the Dev Dashboard provides regex mapping fields and property aliases so Olen adapts to the vault, never forcing the vault to adapt to Olen.

All Dev Dashboard changes are live-reloaded without plugin restart, include import/export as JSON schemas for sharing "Olen flavors" (complete theme + rule packs), and maintain a "Factory Reset" failsafe per category. The Dev Dashboard essentially transforms Olen from a rigid habit-tracking app into a fully programmable life-OS framework where the developer (power user) sculpts the experience definition itself.

# My suggestion
After each feature you add, think if you have to write in on the developer's dashboard. If yes: Write the necessary settings for that feature.
